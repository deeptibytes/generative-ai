      "content='Generative AI refers to a category of artificial intelligence algorithms that are designed to create new content. These algorithms can generate a wide range of outputs, including text, images, music, and even video. The underlying technology often involves deep learning models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).\\n\\nThe unique aspect of generative AI is its ability to produce original content that is not simply a reproduction of the data it was trained on. Instead, it learns patterns and structures from the input data and uses this understanding to create new, previously unseen examples. This ability makes generative AI useful in various applications, such as content creation, design, entertainment, and even drug discovery.\\n\\nKey applications of generative AI include:\\n\\n1. **Text Generation**: Models like GPT-3 can generate human-like text, which can be used for writing articles, answering questions, and even creating dialogue for virtual assistants.\\n\\n2. **Image Creation**: GANs can produce realistic images from scratch, which can be used in art, fashion, and advertising.\\n\\n3. **Music Composition**: AI systems can compose original music tracks, offering new possibilities for musicians and composers.\\n\\n4. **Video and Animation**: AI can generate new video content or enhance existing videos by adding special effects or improving quality.\\n\\n5. **Product Design**: Generative design can create complex structures and products optimized for specific requirements, often used in engineering and architecture.\\n\\nOverall, generative AI represents a powerful set of tools that push the boundaries of creativity and innovation across various fields.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 332, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 345, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_deacdd5f6f', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-71c8e3b5-61e5-4d40-9561-735113dce613-0'\n"
