      "content='Generative AI refers to a category of artificial intelligence techniques that are designed to create new content, data, or models. This type of AI utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning models, to generate text, images, music, video, and other forms of media. The goal of generative AI is to produce outputs that are indistinguishable from those created by humans, often by learning patterns and structures from large datasets.\\n\\nKey technologies in generative AI include:\\n\\n1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which work against each other. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity. Through this adversarial process, the generator improves over time.\\n\\n2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These are used to generate new data by learning a compressed representation of the input data and then decoding it back to a new instance that resembles the original data.\\n\\n3. **Transformers and Language Models:** Models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) are used for generating human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of textual data to understand language patterns and generate coherent and contextually relevant text.\\n\\nGenerative AI has applications across various industries, including entertainment, where it can be used to create art, music, and video content; in business, for automating content creation; and in technology, for simulating environments or creating synthetic data for training other AI systems. It also raises ethical considerations, particularly around issues of authenticity, copyright, and the potential for misuse in creating misleading or harmful content.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 324, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 337, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_deacdd5f6f', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-6bb8515f-6d4d-45d7-a790-c7ec1e2255b1-0'\n"
